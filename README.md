# Los-Angeles-Crime-Analysis-Project

DATA SOURCE: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8

This is an exploratory project that analyzed crimes that have happened in the City of Los Angeles.  

I looked into top crimes reported from 1/1/2000 - Present, the age and sex of the victims of those top crimes, and the most frequent locations of where crimes have happened.

This project was meant to practice what I've learned in my introductory SQL Courses on Data Camp. I used Postgres SQL and pgAdmin 4 for this project.
